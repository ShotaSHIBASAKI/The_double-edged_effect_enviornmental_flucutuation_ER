This repository contains the experimental and simulation data, codes of the mathematical model, and the codes used for the statistical analysis and the data visualization
in Shibasaki and Yamamichi (2024), "The double-edged effect of environmental fluctuations on evolutionary rescue." 

The Rmd code contains all the codes for data analysis and the mathematical model. 
The experimental data and the simulation data are in csv files. 
Please read the Rmd file for more details.
The folder "./SuppData_codes" contains the csv files and the Rmd file that were used to show the results of the pilot experiments. 
(see the Supporting Information of the manuscript).
