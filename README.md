This repository contians the experimental and simulation data, codes of the mathematical model, and the codes used for the statistical analsysi and the data vizualization
in Shibasaki and Yamamichi (2024) "The double-edged effect of environmental fluctuations on evolutionary rescue." 

The Rmd code contains the all codes for data analysis and the mathematical model. The experimental data and the simulation data are in csv files. 
Please read the Rmd file for more details.
The folder "./SuppData_codes" contians the csv files and the Rmd file that were used to show the results of the pilot experiments 
(see the Supporting Infromation of the manuscript).
